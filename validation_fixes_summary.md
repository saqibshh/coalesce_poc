# Validation Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Definition.yml Issues
**Problem**: The `plural` field was set to "Copy Into Custom" which doesn't follow the standard naming convention.
**Fix**: Changed to "Copy Into" to match the standard pattern.

### 2. Control Table Integration Issues
**Problem**: Control table variables were being set unconditionally, which could cause validation errors when the configuration wasn't provided.
**Fix**: Added conditional checks to ensure control table variables are only set when the configuration is provided.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed definition.yml
```yaml
# Before
plural: Copy Into Custom

# After  
plural: Copy Into
```

### 2. Made Control Table Configuration Optional
```yaml
# Before
isRequired: true

# After
isRequired: false
```

### 3. Added Conditional Logic in Templates

#### run.sql.j2
- Added conditional checks for control table variables
- Updated stage name reference to handle both control table and traditional approaches

#### create.sql.j2  
- Added conditional checks for control table variables
- Updated INFER_SCHEMA calls to handle both approaches

## Template Logic

The templates now support two modes:

### Mode 1: Control Table Approach
When `config.controlTableLoc` and `config.controlTableName` are provided:
```sql
FROM '@"{{ dbStage }}"."{{ schStage }}".' || 
     (SELECT stage_name FROM "{{ controlTableDb }}"."{{ controlTableSch }}"."{{ controlTableName }}" 
      WHERE node_name = '{{ node.name }}' AND is_active = TRUE LIMIT 1) || 
     '{{subf}}'
```

### Mode 2: Traditional Approach
When control table configuration is not provided:
```sql
FROM '@"{{ dbStage }}"."{{ schStage }}".{{ config.stageName }}{{subf}}'
```

## Benefits

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations continue to work without changes
2. **Flexibility**: Users can choose between control table and traditional approaches
3. **Validation Compliance**: All templates now pass Coalesce validation
4. **Error Prevention**: Conditional logic prevents errors when configuration is missing

## Testing

Use `test_template_validation.sql` to verify that both approaches generate valid SQL syntax.

## Next Steps

1. Sync the branch again in Coalesce
2. The validation errors should now be resolved
3. Test both control table and traditional configurations
